# DEdit2 TODO

- [ ] Implement `replacetex` console command to update textures in scene data.
- [ ] Implement `freetextures` console command to clear cached textures/preview resources.
- [x] Selection → viewport: click-to-select with hit proxies (even a simple placeholder).
- [x] Basic transform gizmo: translate/rotate/scale on selected node, sync to properties panel.
- [ ] Save workflow: write LTA back out, including supported fields with warnings for unknowns.
- [ ] World browser polish: thumbnails/previews, search, metadata (last modified).
- [ ] Input bindings: configurable hotkeys via console system (save/load bindings).
- [ ] Scene filtering: class/type visibility toggles and isolate selected.
- [x] Undo/redo backbone: command stack for create/delete/rename/move.
- [ ] Asset import stubs: model/texture/sound with placeholder metadata.
- [ ] Error surfacing: parse LTA warnings and push to Console with context.
