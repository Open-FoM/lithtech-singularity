# Tools Overview

Providing content for a modern game engine is a complicated task involving many sophisticated tools: tools for modeling characters, tools for making world architecture, tools for creating textures, tools for making music, and tools for many other tasks. Jupiter provides state-of-the-art tools to content creators and multiple ways to design a given asset or effect. This document describes the functions of the many tools included with Jupiter and also helps you understand how they work so that you can pick the proper ones for the proper tasks.

This section is intended for use by content creators, but other project personnel are encouraged to read the introductions to level design and modeling to develop a basic understanding of how they work. Likewise, non-programmers may find certain sections of the *Programming *section helpful to understanding the overall architecture and capabilities of Jupiter.

This section contains the following topics on using the tools provided with the Jupiter system:
