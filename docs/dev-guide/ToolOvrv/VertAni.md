# Vertex-Animated Models

LithTech also supports vertex-animated models. Vertex-animated models don't use skeletal animations, but use vertex positions to draw the model. This allows for animations not possible with skeletal animation. LithTech supports vertex-animated models exported from 3D Studio MAX and Maya.

Vertex-animated model files tend to be very large. In vertex animation, every vertex has a position stored for every keyframe. In MAX, you can use any technique to animate the vertices and the exporter writes a keyframe for every frame. In Maya you must skin your model, but it exports only set keyframes, and only the bone scaling effects are preserved. Vertex-animated models can be mixed with skeletally animated models, and attachments to skeletally animated models can be vertex-animated models.
