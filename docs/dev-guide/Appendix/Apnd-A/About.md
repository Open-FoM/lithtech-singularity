# Appendix A: About This Guide

This Development Guide provides documentation to aid programmers, artists, and level designers to use Jupiter to create great games.

## Other Documentation and Resources

LithTech maintains a web site for developer issues at [http:\\devnet.touchdownentertainment.com ](http:%5C%5Cdevnet.touchdownentertainment.com). This website provides news, downloads, a release schedule, support, and a mailing list archive.

## Document Conventions

This Guide frequently references files installed from the LithTech Jupiter System CD to your hard drive. Whenever a file path is given in this guide, the root directory is your Jupiter installation directory. The default installation root directory is:

>

c:\lithtech\LT_Jupiter_Bin\ for binary licensees

c:\lithtech\LT_Jupiter_Src\ for source licensees.

The following typographic conventions are used in this book:

monospace —Monospace font identifies a syntax block of source code, examples, user input, file paths, or program output.

**bold **—Bold text identifies an interface, function, data type, macro, or other keyword from the SDK or a programming language.

*italic *—Italicized text signifies placeholders, such as parameters, in a syntax block. In your application implementation, these placeholders must be replaced with appropriate identifiers or values.

[ ]—Brackets encapsulate optional syntax items in syntax blocks. Type only the syntax contained within the brackets, not the brackets themselves.

## Setting Your Font Styles

When reading this document, be sure to set your default fonts to styles that promote online readability. Studies show that readers of online material find it easier to read styles that use sans serif fonts (such as Arial or Helvetica).

| **Note: ** | .CHM Help files use components of the IE browser to create the .CHM Help interface. Because of this, adjustments you make in IE, such as colors, fonts, languages, and accessibility, apply to all of the .CHM Help systems on your entire computer. You can change the fonts displayed by .CHM files by clicking the Options button and selecting Internet Options (which opens the IE Internet Options dialog box). Then, on the General tab, click the Fonts button and select the font (typeface) you wish to view in the Help system interface. |
