# Editing Shortcut Keys

DEdit uses many shortcut keys, and in most cases it is far easier to use the shortcut keys than to use the menus. Some options, such as camera movement, require shortcut keys and are not available on the menus. For this reason DEdit has a shortcut key editor that allows you to change the key combinations associated with commands. Additionally, some commands are unassociated with key combinations by default, and in order to enable them you must assign a key combination to the command. For information about the currently assigned shortcut keys, see [DEdit Shortcut Keys ](Keys.md), or in the DEdit **Edit **menu, click **Edit Key Configuration **.

This section covers the following shortcut key editing topics:

- [Navigating the Current Key Configuration Dialog ](#NavigatingtheCurrentKeyConfigurationDialog)
- [Changing or Adding a Shortcut Key ](#ChangingorAddingaShortcutKey)
- [Clearing and Reseting Shortcut Keys ](#ResetingandRemovingShortcutKeys)
