# DEdit Shortcut Keys

Control and creation of objects in DEdit involves a large number of shortcut keys. For maximum control over the DEdit application you are advised to memorize some of the most commonly used shortcut keys.

Shortcut keys for some functions do not exist when DEdit is started, and if you wish to use them you must define a shortcut key for them. Functions without assigned shortcut keys are listed in the User Defined Shortcut Keys section.

| **Note: ** | To acces a full list of shortcut keys, on the Edit menu, click Edit Key Configuration. |
