# Using the Camera

This section explains how to use the camera in the 3D viewport.

For information about using the camera in the three 2D viewports, see the [Using the Viewports ](TBldWrld.md#UsingtheViewports)topic in the [Building Your First World ](TBldWrld.md)tutorial. Remember, for 2D viewports: press and hold the I key and move the mouse in a 2D viewport to pan the view around the level. Press the O key and use the mouse to zoom the camera in and out.

## 3D View

The 3D view is more complicated and very useful. For a tour of the 3D view, follow these steps:

1. Hover your mouse over the 3D viewport (top left).
2. Press and hold the I key and move the mouse around slowly. The window’s camera moves in the horizontal plane as you move the mouse.
3. To move vertically, press and hold the right mouse button.
4. To move faster, press and hold the left mouse button.
5. Release the I key.
6. Press and hold the O key, then move the mouse slowly. Now, instead of moving, the camera turns. It operates just as the “mouse look” mode does in a first-person game. If you’re not careful you can turn the camera completely upside down, so be sure not to move the mouse around too wildly.
7. Also, you can use the left and right mouse buttons to move forward and backward along the camera’s sight-path, respectively.

With these controls, you can move the camera anywhere in the map you need to see something. You can also see the object from any angle.

## Center View Buttons

There are two other controls that set camera location. On the WorldEdit toolbar, the Center View and Center View On Marker buttons

set the center point of the camera. These buttons are useful for rapidly moving the camera to a new location on the map, and you’ll probably find yourself using them a lot in large maps.

The Center View button centers the camera on the selected objects or brushes, or on the middle of a selected group of objects or brushes.

The Center View On Marker button moves the camera so that it’s aimed at the green marker.

## View Modes

Right-click on any viewport to display the Context menu. Use the commands on the Context menu to change the view that your camera presents in the Perspective viewport.

The Shade Mode and Move Mode commands both control the way that the camera works in that port. The Shade Mode menu lets you switch between textured, flat-shaded (un-textured), and wireframe views of the level.

Flat shading and wireframe display are useful for seeing how your brushes are laid out, since textures can obscure seams between two brushes, making some tasks difficult. These modes are also faster in some cases, so if DEdit runs especially slowly on your machine you may want to use them to speed things up.
