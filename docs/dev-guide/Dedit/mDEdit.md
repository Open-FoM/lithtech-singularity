# Using DEdit

![](../Images/DETBar/DEditLogo.gif)

DEdit is a tool that allows you to build the ground, sky, walls, ceilings and shapes for your levels. It is also used to assemble parts of your level that you’ve built in a supported external 3D package, such as 3D Studio Max or Maya. You can then apply or modify textures, props, prefabs, lights and sounds to give them a realistic appearance. No One Lives Forever 2 was created using literally thousands of these assets. You can also add the simulation objects that allow other players to interact with your world.

Creating levels is an extremely complex and time consuming process, and the following instructions are merely the starting point for those who want to learn the basics of building worlds for Jupiter. If you have previously designed 3D or near-3D games, then you have probably worked with tools like DEdit.

| **Note: ** | While you can use the No One Lives Forever 2 objects and code provided with Jupiter, the art resources are included as samples only and cannot be included in any released games. TO2 textures, models, levels, and animations are the property of Monolith Productions, and may not be included in any released product. |
