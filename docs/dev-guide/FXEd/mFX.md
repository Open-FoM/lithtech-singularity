# Using FxEd

![](../Images/Logos/FZLogo.gif)

This section covers how to use the FxEd application to create a group of FX and details the properties of each individual FX. Suggestions for some common uses for each FX and which FX should be used to create a specific special effect are provided.

Creating special effects for previous games meant having an engineer and an artist sit down together to create the FX in code and then expose a few properties for tweaking in a text file. This severely limited the types of special effects we could have and limited the behavior of the FX we did have. Jupiter’s FxEd application enables you to create and edit virtually any special effect. With FxEd you can specify the length of a whole group of FX, the length of an individual FX, the scale, color and alpha at any point in time for an individual FX and you can even create a motion path for each individual FX to follow without setting up lots of key framers in DEdit.

| **Note: ** | The term "FX" refers to individual objects that are considered special effects. An FX can be a ParticleSystemFX, SpriteFX, or even a NullFX. The term "GroupFX" is a collection of FX. A GroupFX may contain one or many FX. When working with FxEd you are creating GroupFX by adding FX to them. |

Each FX has a set of properties that you can edit. Some of these properties are common between all the FX but most are specific to the individual FX. This section contains the following topics related to creating special effects:
