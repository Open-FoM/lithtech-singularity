# Using Motion Keys

For FX that allow you to create and edit motion keys, you access this interface by right clicking on a Key in the GroupFX and select Edit Motion Keys from the menu. This will bring up a dialog box with a large black square split into quads. This large black square is your view of the motion keys. By default the view is the Front view. To change the view simply right click on the yellow text in the upper left corner that says View and select the desired view from the menu.

To create keys, click the Create button on the right hand side and then click in the view area in the desired spot of your motion. The next key you create will draw a line from the last one showing the path of the motion. The FX will travel from the first key to the last key in the lifetime of the FX. To move a motion key once it is placed, click the Move button on the right hand side and click and drag the key to the desired position. You may also scale and rotate selected keys.
