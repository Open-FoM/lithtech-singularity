# Creating A GroupFX

To create a new GroupFX simply click on the new icon and a blank GroupFX will appear. By default all GroupFX start off with a Phase Length of 10000. Phase Length is the lifetime of the GroupFX in milliseconds so each GroupFX is 10 seconds long by default. To change this, just click on the button that says 10000 and enter in a new time.

To start adding FX to this GroupFX you will first need to add a Track. Tracks are holders for Keys. Keys are the specific individual FX. Each Key needs to be placed on a Track. You can have multiple Keys per Track or you can have each Track contain only one Key. To add a Track, right click in the gray area of the GroupFX and selecting Add Track.

Once you have added a Track you will need to add a Key. Right click on an empty space in a Track and select Add Key. A popup box will appear with a list of FX you can add for this Key. Select the type of FX you would like to add and it will then appear on your Track. You can now move this Key around your Track so you can set when you would like this FX to begin playing. You can also lengthen the FX by grabbing its edges and growing or shrinking the Key to the desired length.

To have the FX play for the whole duration of the GroupFX, right click on the Key and select Expand Key from the menu. If you have many FX that are of the same type you may want to differentiate them from each other by giving them each a unique name. To do this right click on the key and select Name Key from the popup menu and enter in a custom name for this Key.

Now that you have your Key set to the desired length and start time you can edit the properties of the FX by right clicking on the Key and selecting Edit Key. A popup dialog box appears with several different properties listed for you to edit. From the same right click menu you can select options to edit the scale of the FX, the color of the FX and create motion for the FX. Not all FX types expose the ability to edit all of these options. A list of FX and properties that you can edit are listed below.
