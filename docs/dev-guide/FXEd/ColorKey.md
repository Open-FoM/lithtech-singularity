# Using Color Keys

For FX that allow you to create and edit color keys, you access this interface by right clicking on a Key in the GroupFX and select Edit Color Keys from the menu. This will bring up a dialog box with a large colored bar numbered from 0 to the lifetime of the Key. The full time of the FX is represented in the bar along the bottom. The alpha of the FX at a particular time is represented on the left side.

From here you can create new color keys or edit the two preexisting keys. There are always at least two color keys per FX, one for the very beginning of the FX and one for the end of the FX. By default these two keys are set to the color white and are fully opaque.

To create a new key, simply click in the color bar at the time you wish the new key to be and at the alpha you want the new key to be. You are then prompted to choose a color for the key.

After a key is created you can move it around to the time and alpha desired by left clicking the key and dragging it to the desired values. You can change the color of a color key by right clicking on one and choosing a color from the color menu.

To delete a key simply select it by left clicking and then click the Delete Key button. You cannot delete the two preexisting beginning and end keys. If you create a set of color keys that you wish to use for other FX you can save them by clicking on the Add To Favorites button. You can select from a list of favorite color keys by selecting the choose button.
