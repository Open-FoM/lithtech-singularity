# Using Scale Keys

For FX that allow you to create and edit scale keys, you access this interface by right clicking on a Key in the GroupFX and select Edit Scale Keys from the menu. This will bring up a dialog box with a large white bar numbered from 0 to the lifetime of the FX. The full lifetime of the FX is represented in the bar at the bottom and the Scale of the FX at a particular time is represented on the left side, ranging from Min Scale to Max Scale.

From here you can create new scale keys or edit the two preexisting keys. There are always at least two scale keys per FX, one for the very beginning of the FX and one for the end of the FX. By default these two keys are set to a scale of 1.

To change the Min and Max scale for this FX, click on the numbered buttons for Min Scale and Max Scale and then enter a new value.

To create new scale keys, click in the white bar at the time and scale you desire. You may move the key to the desired time and scale after creating by clicking and dragging the key.

To delete a key, right click on it and then select Delete Key from the menu. You cannot delete the two preexisting beginning and end keys. If you wish to start over again click the Reset button. This will delete all but the two beginning and end keys and set them to be at 10% of the Max Scale value.

If you create a set of scale keys that you wish to use for other FX you can save them by clicking on the Add To Favorites button. You can select from a list of favorite scale keys by selecting the choose button.
