# Getting Started With FX

FxEd is the application used to create the GroupFX that will be used in your game. When FxEd runs for the first time on your computer you will have to fill out a dialog box of information telling FxEd where to look for resources and the file containing the FX.

If you wish to run the game from within FxEd you will need to edit the App to execute… text box to be the full path name of your LithTech.exe file. You can also enter in optional information into the command line if you wish to run the game in a window or load a specific level.

You must fill out the Location of resource file… box. This tells FxEd where to look for the resources such as .LTB and .SPR files. This should be the full path of your Game directory.

The Location and name of clientfx.fxd… box also needs to be filled out in order to get the list of FX you can use. This should be the full path from the Location of resource file… box with \clientfx.fxd added to the end.

FxEd is now ready for you to work with and will never ask you for this information again. If you made a mistake in entering in the info or would like to change some options for the command line you can do so by selecting Edit Game Info form the File menu.

You will now want to open the file that contains all the GroupFX for the game. Click the open icon and open the clientfx.fxf file found in the Game\ClientFX directory. You will now have a list of GroupFX that you can open and edit.
