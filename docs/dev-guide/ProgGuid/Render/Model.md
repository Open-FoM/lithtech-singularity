# Model Rendering

There are two types of models: world models (built in DEdit) and models imported from modeling software (for example, Maya or Max). World models are always rigid (lacking bones). Imported models can be rigid, skeletal animated, or vertex animated.

Both types of models are read into the LithTech engine as .LTB files (binary files packed specifically for the target platform).

Alpha blended models are sorted and rendered after all the opaque models have been rendered.
