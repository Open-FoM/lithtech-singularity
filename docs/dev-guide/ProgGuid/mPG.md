# Programming Guide

The LithTech Jupiter system programming guide contains information relating to coding games using the Jupiter system. Previous sections have described how Level Designers and Graphic Artists can create levels, models, and brushes using the tools provided with Jupiter. This section focuses on how to create your game code to interact using the levels and objects you have created.
