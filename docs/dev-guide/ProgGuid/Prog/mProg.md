# Programming Overview

Jupiter contains dozens of interfaces, scores of structures and enumerated types, and hundreds of functions. This section provides Jupiter-specific advice and guidance for common game coding tasks. Of course, review of the source code is an invaluable and irreplaceable requirement to understanding Jupiter and successfully developing your own game. Jupiter includes the full source code for the sequel to No One Lives Forever. You can use this game code to help you understand the engine code.

There are many ways to code a game using Jupiter. This document explains issues and subjects that you should keep in mind when developing your game. Your game code may radically depart from the simple examples given here and still operate normally.

This section contains the following topics:

| #### Topic | #### Description |
