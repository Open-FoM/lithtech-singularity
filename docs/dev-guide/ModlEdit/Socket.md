# Adding Sockets

Sockets are places in models where you can add attachments. Attachments are sub-models that do not deform with the main model. Also, attachments can be changed dynamically in the game. Usually attachments are guns, hats, and sometimes even armor pieces. The socket or attachment sites are normal transformations that are manipulated in the Transform Edit control or from the Sockets list.

#### To add a socket

1. In the Nodes list select a node where you want to create a socket.
2. In the Sockets menu select Add Socket. Enter a name for the new socket.
3. Click OK.
4. A socket appears in the Sockets list. Double-click its name to open the Socket Properties dialog.
5. In the Attachment box, either browse for or type the name of the .LTA file to add as an attachment.
6. You can also change the socket's name in the Name box, or explicitly change its Position and Orientation in the respective X, Y, and Z boxes.
7. Click Apply to see your attachment in the model view window. You can make changes in the Socket Properties dialog and click Apply to refine your attachment.
8. Click OK to close the Socket Properties dialog.

The attachment .LTA file will be kept in the model's data as a reference that can be changed during the game. This allows you to switch models on a socket while the game is going. For example, if a player picks up new power-ups, armor, or even clothing, you can add to it and modify it during the game.
